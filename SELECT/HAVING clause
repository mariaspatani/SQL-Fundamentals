HAVING CLAUSE
 * Definition

The HAVING clause is used to filter groups of rows formed by the GROUP BY clause.
It is mainly used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN().

* Syntax
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;

* Why HAVING is needed?

WHERE cannot be used with aggregate functions

HAVING applies conditions after grouping
